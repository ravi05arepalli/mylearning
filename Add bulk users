.SYNOPSIS
    This script adds users to specific Active Directory (AD) groups based on their region.

.DESCRIPTION
    The script reads user information from a CSV file and adds users to different AD groups based on their region.
    - If the region is "US", the user is added to the "secCLICKPersona-NA-DCV-Power" group.
    - If the region is "EU", the user is added to the "secCLICKPersona-EU-DCV-Power" group.

.EXAMPLE
    Make sure your CSV file has columns named Username and Region. For example:

    Username,Region
    User1,US
    User2,EU
    User3,US

    Save the script and run it in PowerShell:
    .\Add-UsersToADGroup.ps1
#>

# Import the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Define the groups
$groupUS = "secCLICKPersona-NA-DCV-Power"
$groupEU = "secCLICKPersona-EU-DCV-Power"

# Import the CSV file
$csvPath = "D:\Scripts\AWSVDI\Users.csv" # Replace with the actual path to your CSV file
$users = Import-Csv -Path $csvPath

# Loop through each user in the CSV
foreach ($user in $users) {
    if ($user.Region -eq "US") {
        Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupUS -Members $user.Username
        Write-Host "Added $($user.Username) to $groupUS"
    } elseif ($user.Region -eq "EU") {
        Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $groupEU -Members $user.Username
        Write-Host "Added $($user.Username) to $groupEU"
    } else {
        Write-Host "Region for $($user.Username) is not recognized"
    }
}
